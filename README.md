This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in JavaScript related to the `arguments` object. The `arguments` object in JavaScript is not an array and behaves differently than expected. The bug showcases the unexpected behavior of the `arguments` object when trying to access its properties or using array methods directly on it.  The solution provides an explanation of the issue and shows how to properly handle the `arguments` object or use rest parameters instead.
